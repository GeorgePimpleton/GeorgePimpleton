This is no longer the case, I've moved on.  The site is just marking time until the site owner pulls the plug.

At this time CPlusPlus is not accepting new members.  You can read what's going on, you just can't participate. :(

And what is happening ain't much.

I am a self-taught C/C++/Windows API programming ***hobbyist***, been learning for decades.  Started before C++98 was adopted, when the only C++ was ANSI C++.  Yeah, that long ago.

I am certainly a *"noob"* when it comes to git and github. :Ãž

My profile picture shows my current feline, a very aloof and ornery neutered male that sometimes answers to the name of "Smokey."
