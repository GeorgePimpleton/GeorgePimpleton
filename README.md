- Hi, Iâ€™m George P (NOT my meat world name)
- ðŸ‘€ You can usually find me hanging at in the forums @ https://cplusplus.com/  At this time CPlusPlus is not accepting new members.

I am a self-taught C/C++/Windows API programming ***hobbyist***, been learning for decades.

I am certainly a "noob" when it comes to git and github. :Ãž

My profile picture shows my current feline, a very aloof and ornery netured male that sometimes answers to the name of "Smokey."
