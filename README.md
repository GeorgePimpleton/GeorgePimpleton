At this time CPlusPlus is not accepting new members.  You can read what's going on, you just can't participate. :(

I am a self-taught C/C++/Windows API programming ***hobbyist***, been learning for decades.  Started before C++98 was adopted, when the only C++ was ANSI C++.  Yeah, that long ago.

I am certainly a *"noob"* when it comes to git and github. :Ãž

My profile picture shows my current feline, a very aloof and ornery netured male that sometimes answers to the name of "Smokey."
