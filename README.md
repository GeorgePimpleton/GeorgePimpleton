- Hi, Iâ€™m George P (NOT my meat world name)
- ðŸ‘€ You can usually find me hanging at in the forums @ https://cplusplus.com/

I am a self-taught C/C++/Windows API programming ***hobbyist***, been learning for decades.

My profile picture shows my current feline, a very aloof and ornery netured male named "Smokey."
